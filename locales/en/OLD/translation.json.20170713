It has proven track records of securely storing data from various applications from medical record to simple game, which run on various platforms like Android, iOS, Windows, installed on various devices such as smart phones, tablets, PC, sensors.<br /><br />From functional point of view, since you can create as many OASIS OData spaces to handle relational data, you will benefit from flexible data API with advanced features such as various searchs and optimistic lock. Also, WebDAV feature enables CRUD operation of file data such as image, sound, movie media in a simple and smart manner.",
    "interconnectable" : "Personium enables secure data sharing among interconnected data stores. This feature enables such systems that multiple organizations and individuals cooperate in a complex manner. Some system may enable a home doctor to use his/her patient's blood pressure data that care workers measured a few days ago. Other system may enable a private tutor to refer to his/her student's arithmetics weak point that school teacher has just finded out. In short, it enables something new, which could not be achieved due to the separation of systems. Data stores are also interconnectable beyond the server infrastructures, because the trust among data stores is achieved using PKI technology.",
